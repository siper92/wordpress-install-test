# Detailed Implementation Plan: Subscription Management Architecture

## Project Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a separated subscription management system where storefronts handle product display and initial checkout, while a dedicated billing site manages subscriptions, renewals, and payment processing.

## Architecture Components

### 1. System Architecture
```
[Storefront Site(s)] → [Secure Token Exchange] → [Billing Site]
       ↓                                            ↓
[Custom Payment Gateway]                    [WooCommerce Subscriptions]
       ↓                                            ↓
[Webhook Callbacks] ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← [Payment Processing]
```

### 2. Core Components Implementation Plan

#### A. Custom Payment Gateway Plugin (Storefront)
**Purpose**: Handle subscription order initiation and redirect to billing site

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Plugin Structure Setup**
   - Create WordPress plugin with proper headers
   - Extend WC_Payment_Gateway class
   - Register gateway with WooCommerce

2. **Order Processing Logic**
   - Create order with 'pending' status on storefront
   - Generate secure token for billing site communication
   - Redirect customer to billing site with encrypted order data

3. **Token Generation & Security**
   - Implement HMAC-SHA256 signing mechanism
   - Include order ID, customer data, and timestamp
   - Set token expiration (e.g., 30 minutes)

4. **Retry Payment Functionality**
   - Integrate with WooCommerce's order-pay endpoint
   - Handle failed payment retry scenarios
   - Update order status based on billing site callbacks

#### B. Billing Site Setup & Configuration
**Purpose**: Dedicated subscription management and payment processing

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **WooCommerce Subscriptions Configuration**
   - Install and license WooCommerce Subscriptions
   - Configure subscription settings (renewal intervals, retry logic)
   - Set up automatic renewal processing

2. **Payment Gateway Integration**
   - Configure Mollie/Adyen payment gateways
   - Set up webhook endpoints for payment status updates
   - Implement retry logic for failed payments

3. **Token Validation System**
   - Create endpoint to receive storefront tokens
   - Validate HMAC signatures and token expiration
   - Process subscription creation from validated tokens

4. **Subscription Management**
   - Handle subscription lifecycle (creation, renewal, cancellation)
   - Process payment retries and failure handling
   - Manage subscription status updates

#### C. Secure Communication Protocol
**Purpose**: Ensure secure data exchange between storefront and billing site

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Token-Based Authentication**
   - Implement JWT or HMAC-based token system
   - Include shared secret key configuration
   - Add timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks

2. **Webhook System**
   - Create webhook endpoints on storefront
   - Implement signature verification for incoming webhooks
   - Handle order status updates from billing site

3. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt sensitive customer data in transit
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper error handling for failed requests

#### D. Customer Dashboard & OTP Authentication
**Purpose**: Provide customer access without traditional account registration

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **OTP Email System**
   - Create one-time password generation system
   - Implement email delivery mechanism
   - Add OTP validation and expiration logic

2. **Dashboard Interface**
   - Build subscription management interface
   - Display payment history and billing information
   - Implement subscription modification options

3. **Multi-language Support**
   - Use WordPress i18n functions for all text
   - Create translation-ready templates
   - Implement language detection and switching

- Implement comprehensive test suite
- Perform load testing for scalability
- Document wp endpoints and workflows

## Technical Specifications

### Custom Payment Gateway Code Structure
```php
class Storefront_Subscription_Gateway extends WC_Payment_Gateway {
    // Gateway initialization and settings
    // Token generation methods
    // Redirect to billing site logic
    // Webhook handling for status updates
    // Retry payment functionality
}
```

### Token Generation Algorithm
```php
function generate_secure_token($order_data) {
    $timestamp = time();
    $payload = base64_encode(json_encode([
        'order_id' => $order_data['id'],
        'customer_email' => $order_data['email'],
        'timestamp' => $timestamp,
        'expires' => $timestamp + 1800 // 30 minutes
    ]));

    $signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, SHARED_SECRET);
    return $payload . '.' . $signature;
}
```

### Webhook Verification
```php
function verify_webhook_signature($payload, $signature) {
    $expected = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, SHARED_SECRET);
    return hash_equals($expected, $signature);
}
```

## Security & Compliance Considerations

### PCI Compliance
- Storefront never handles payment card data
- All payment processing occurs on certified billing site
- Implement proper data sanitization and validation
- Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS/TLS)

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Implement proper access controls and authentication
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- GDPR compliance for customer data handling

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test token generation and validation functions
- Verify webhook signature validation
- Test OTP generation and verification
- Validate payment retry logic

### Integration Testing

- Webhook communication between sites
- Payment gateway integration testing
- Multi-language functionality testing

### Performance Testing
- Load testing for high-traffic scenarios
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategy implementation
- CDN integration for static assets

### Security Testing
- Penetration testing for authentication bypass
- Token replay attack prevention
- SQL injection and XSS vulnerability testing
- wp endpoint security validation

## Scalability Considerations
